# Day 3: Deploy Workflow

## Goal

Setup an automatic deploy workflow.

## GitHub Webhooks

In Dashboard > LeanEngine > Settings > Source code deployment,
fill in the git repository url:
<https://github.com/weakish/internalerror.git>

Then generate the webhook url (leave branch to its default value `master`),
and paste this webhook url in GitHub repository settings > webhooks.

Now I just need to push to the `master` branch of the GitHub repository,
the project will be deployed to LeanEngine automatically.

To deploy a specific revision (for example, a hotfix), run the following command:

```sh
lean up -g -r <revision>
```
